 * @param {string} [ariaLive] The politeness level for aria-live; default: 'polite'.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import { speak } from '@wordpress/a11y';
 *
 * // For polite messages that shouldn't interrupt what screen readers are currently announcing.
 * speak( 'The message you want to send to the ARIA live region' );
 *
 * // For assertive messages that should interrupt what screen readers are currently announcing.
 * speak( 'The message you want to send to the ARIA live region', 'assertive' );
 * ```
