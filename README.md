### üö´ There are *no limits* on:

Businesses [save $1,000s a year](https://groundhogg.io/pricing/) after switching to Groundhogg.

## üíΩ You own your data!

The reality of SaaS CRMs is that you pay, and pay, and pay, and you invest all this money into a system to help your business thrive, but it can be taken away at a moments notice.

Putting your data in a SaaS CRM is like renting an apartment, but with less protection and stingier landlords. You can get evicted at any time, for any reason. There is no recourse.

This leaves your business exposed. What would happen to your business if your CRM was turned off?

With Groundhogg you actually [own your data](https://www.groundhogg.io/learn/email-and-self-hosting-is-now-more-critical-than-ever/)! No one expect you can make impactful changes.

## üí° Made by people who know CRM & Marketing Automation!

Our team is based in Niagara Falls, Canada! We've been helping small businesses implement CRM and Marketing Automation since 2014 working with tools like Keap, ActiveCampaign, and HubSpot.

After some time, it became apparent that there was a desperate need in the WordPress ecosystem for a capable CRM and Marketing Automation tool for WordPress site owners.

One that could match SaaS platforms on features and reliability did not yet exist, so we built it!

Starting in 2018, Adrian Tobey (founder) and his team took their combined 20+ years of experience in the CRM and Marketing Automation industry to create a better option for WordPress based businesses.

We know flows, CRM, and marketing automation like the back of our hands!

## Development: Coding Standards

This project uses PHP_CodeSniffer with WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS) and PHPCompatibility.

- Ruleset: see .phpcs.xml.dist at the project root.
- Install dev tools: run `composer install` (Composer will install PHPCS and register standards).
- Verify WPCS configuration: `composer run wpcs:doctor`
  - Expected: `Installed standards` includes `WordPress`, `WordPress-Core`, `WordPress-Extra`, `WordPress-Docs`.
  - Expected: `installed_paths` shows `vendor/wp-coding-standards/wpcs` and `vendor/phpcompatibility/php-compatibility`.
- Lint: `composer run lint:php`
- Auto-fix: `composer run lint:php:fix`

IDE integration (PhpStorm):
- PhpStorm will auto-detect .phpcs.xml.dist. To run inspections, enable ‚ÄúPHP | Quality tools | PHP_CodeSniffer‚Äù and point the PHPCS binary to `vendor\bin\phpcs` (Windows) or `vendor/bin/phpcs` (macOS/Linux). Set the configuration to ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù and the standard will be read from the ruleset.
- You can also set a File Watcher to run `phpcbf` on save using `vendor\\bin\\phpcbf`.



## Enabling WPCS inspections in PhpStorm

If you are not seeing WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS) inspections in PhpStorm, follow these steps. This project already includes PHPCS/WPCS config files at the root: `.phpcs.xml.dist`, `.phpcs.xml`, and `phpcs.xml`.

1) Ensure PhpStorm uses the project PHPCS binary
- Open: Settings > PHP > Quality Tools > PHP_CodeSniffer
- Configuration: Local
- PHP_CodeSniffer path (Windows): `C:\Users\adria\PhpstormProjects\groundhogg\vendor\bin\phpcs.bat`
- Click Validate. You should see version and Installed standards including: WordPress, WordPress-Core, WordPress-Docs, WordPress-Extra, PHPCompatibility, PHPCompatibilityWP, etc.

2) Enable inspections and choose the standard/ruleset
Depending on PhpStorm version, you may see slightly different UI labels.
- Go to: Settings > Editor > Inspections > PHP > Quality tools > PHP_CodeSniffer validation
- Enable the checkbox to turn on PHPCS inspections in the editor.
- Choose ONE of the following:
  - Ruleset file: Select the project file `.phpcs.xml` (root). PhpStorm should auto-detect this as the default ruleset.
  - OR Coding standard: Select `WordPress` (this is a reliable fallback as vendor PHPCS definitely has WordPress installed).

Notes
- If using a global phpcs, this project‚Äôs rulesets also include a fallback `installed_paths` config to help global PHPCS locate WPCS and PHPCompatibility under `vendor`.
- CLI checks (run from project root):
  - `vendor\bin\phpcs -i` (should list WordPress and PHPCompatibility standards)
  - `vendor\bin\phpcs -sp --standard=WordPress admin\events\events-page.php` (should report WPCS findings)
  - `vendor\bin\phpcbf` to auto-fix fixable issues.

If inspections still don‚Äôt appear, ensure the Editor > Inspections page has PHP_CodeSniffer validation enabled, and try switching between selecting the `.phpcs.xml` ruleset file and selecting the `WordPress` coding standard directly. Also confirm no file-level suppression is active in the current file.
