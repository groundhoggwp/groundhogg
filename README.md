### 🚫 There are *no limits* on:

* Number of contacts

Businesses [save $1,000s a year](https://groundhogg.io/pricing/) after switching to Groundhogg.

## 💽 You own your data!

The reality of SaaS CRMs is that you pay, and pay, and pay, and you invest all this money into a system to help your business thrive, but it can be taken away at a moments notice.

Putting your data in a SaaS CRM is like renting an apartment, but with less protection and stingier landlords. You can get evicted at any time, for any reason. There is no recourse.

This leaves your business exposed. What would happen to your business if your CRM was turned off?

With Groundhogg you actually [own your data](https://www.groundhogg.io/learn/email-and-self-hosting-is-now-more-critical-than-ever/)! No one expect you can make impactful changes.

## 💡 Made by people who know CRM & Marketing Automation!

Our team is based in Niagara Falls, Canada! We've been helping small businesses implement CRM and Marketing Automation since 2014 working with tools like Keap, ActiveCampaign, and HubSpot.

After some time, it became apparent that there was a desperate need in the WordPress ecosystem for a capable CRM and Marketing Automation tool for WordPress site owners.

One that could match SaaS platforms on features and reliability did not yet exist, so we built it!

Starting in 2018, Adrian Tobey (founder) and his team took their combined 20+ years of experience in the CRM and Marketing Automation industry to create a better option for WordPress based businesses.

We know flows, CRM, and marketing automation like the back of our hands!

You can trust us to not only provide you with stellar software and support, but also provide you guidance on the kinds of flows and automation you should be building to get maximum value from our products.
