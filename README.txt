Groundhogg CRM & Marketing Automation for WordPress can help you dramatically improve how you acquire leads and make more sales!

Our award winning WordPress CRM is the very best alternative to [Keap](https://www.groundhogg.io/comparison/keap-infusionsoft/), [ActiveCampaign](https://www.groundhogg.io/comparison/activecampaign/), [HighLevel](https://www.groundhogg.io/comparison/gohighlevel/), [HubSpot](https://www.groundhogg.io/comparison/hubspot/), [MailChimp](https://www.groundhogg.io/comparison/mailchimp/) and [other SaaS platforms](https://www.groundhogg.io/crm-type/saas/).

You don‚Äôt have to sacrifice CRM features when you switch to our self-hosted solution. In fact you can **[save $1,000s per year](https://www.groundhogg.io/compare/)** and have the added benefit of owning all your information.

If you are an agency, WaaS, WordPress developer, LMS/Course Creator, WordPress freelancer, or CRM implementation service provider then the Groundhogg CRM and Marketing Automation suite is for you.

## ü™ì Ax the "Success Tax"

Other SaaS (Software as a Service) CRM platforms will charge you more as your list grows.

**But not us!**

When using the Groundhogg CRM & Marketing Automation suite free or with any of our paid plans, _we'll never charge you more_!

### üö´ There are *no limits* on:

* Number of contacts
* Number of flows (automations)
* Number of emails sent

When using Groundhogg CRM & Marketing Automation you will **never** be limited on the amount of **anything**! Unlike [other SaaS platforms](https://www.groundhogg.io/compare/).

Businesses [save $1,000s a year](https://groundhogg.io/pricing/) after switching to Groundhogg.

## üíΩ You own your data!

The reality of SaaS CRMs is that you pay, and pay, and pay, and you invest all this money into a system to help your business thrive, but it can be taken away at a moments notice.

Putting your data in a SaaS CRM is like renting an apartment, but with less protection and stingier landlords. You can get evicted at any time, for any reason. There is no recourse.

This leaves your business exposed. What would happen to your business if your CRM was turned off?

With Groundhogg you actually [own your data](https://www.groundhogg.io/learn/email-and-self-hosting-is-now-more-critical-than-ever/)! No one expect you can make impactful changes.

Our team is based in Niagara Falls, Canada! We've been helping small businesses implement CRM and Marketing Automation since 2014 working with tools like Keap, ActiveCampaign, and HubSpot.

After some time, it became apparent that there was a desperate need in the WordPress ecosystem for a capable CRM and Marketing Automation tool for WordPress site owners.

One that could match SaaS platforms on features and reliability did not yet exist, so we built it!

We know flows, CRM, and marketing automation like the back of our hands!
